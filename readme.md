## Known Bugs
- PATCHED Playback time does not pause when audio playback is paused, stops counting but upon starting audio again time jumps forward.
- PATCHED Even when no song is loaded hovering off the play button dims the ui.

## Feature plans
- Audio seeking, requires rework to use webaudio instead of threejs as audio source
- google search for album covers when not found on MusicBrainz
- Mobile UI
- Volume Slider
- Intensity slider
- Color Schemes
- Collapsible settings menu
